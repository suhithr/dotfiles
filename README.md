# Dotfiles

This is for easy setup and portability of my most commonly used dotfiles across new machines.
From a highly customized shell terminal zsh (archived) I've switched to fish.

Running `minimal_install.sh` on Mac or Linux will

1. (On Mac) Install homebrew and the fish shell
2. Link my configs to the home directory.
  a. config.fish
  b. .vimrc
  c. .gitconfig
  d. vscode keybindings (only on Mac currently since that's where I write code).
